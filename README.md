# PH-SA
## Introduce

Here, we introduce a topology-based automatic active phase construction framework, enabling the thorough configuration sampling and efficient computation.



## Requirements

The code in this repo has been tested with the following software versions:

- Python 3.8.13

- Ase 3.22

- Gudhi 3.8

- Numpy 1.23

- Networkx 2.8.8

- Scipy 1.10.1 

    

## Files

#### Methods

- `cluter_topo.py`:  Searching for surface and embedding sites for aperiodicity structure.
- `inside_topo.py`: Searching for surface and embedding sites for periodicity structure.

#### Workflow

Demonstrates brief examples and workflow

#### Example

Simple structure for running workflow.
